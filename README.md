# Upstate Data Summit

This repository holds information about, and a website for, the 2018 Upstate Data Summit, to be held in Syracuse, NY - on the campus of Syracuse University - in [mid June](https://github.com/UpstateData/data-summit/issues/1).

## Event Overview

Publishing open data, and using data to drive operational and policy decisions have become important tools for municipal government officials. A number of governments across Upstate New York have adopted new policies and practices aimed at leveraging the power of data to provide more efficient and more equitable public services. But the use of data to drive government operations and policy decisions is not evenly spread, and opportunities to share ideas and best practices are few and far between.

The Upstate Data Summit will bring together municipal government officials from across Upstate New York to showcase innovative uses of data and open data publishing. It will provide an opportunity for attendees to learn more about how other Upstate governments are using data, and how governments new to open data and data-driven decision making can get started with data programs of their own.

The program will feature speakers from Upstate governments that have adopted policies and practices around the use of data, and will highlight lessons learned from these leaders and tips on getting started. The event will be held in Syracuse in June of 2018.
